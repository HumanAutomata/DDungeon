We strongly recommend passing in an `attention_mask` since your input_ids may be padded. See https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/troubleshooting#incorrect-output-when-padding-tokens-arent-masked.
You may ignore this warning if your `pad_token_id` (50256) is identical to the `bos_token_id` (50256), `eos_token_id` (50256), or the `sep_token_id` (None), and your input is not padded.

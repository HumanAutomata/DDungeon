# Room2

words: green, nature, lush, full of life, magical, 5

as you enter you see a garden, and small faries flying around and taking care of herbs
- if you have the amulet, they will approach and try to communicate
- if not, skip to the choice

- 5 faries approach you and say:
    - you notice that they all have 5 pairs of wings
    - encoded text using a ceaser cypher (rot 5)
    - something like:
        this human looks kind,
        maybe Njord (a nice Norse god) had a point

## Choice

1. ignore them and try to find an exit
- they will leave you alone and not interact with you
2. attack / try to capture one
- If you have the sword you can injure one, but then you get swarmed
- otherwise, you just get swarmed and GG
3. try and talk back to them

the challenge is walking past plants and performing the right action to get past each one

if you talk to the faries, they will follow you and give you hints

at the end, you find a big gap
- if you had the faries folow and the amulet, they will fry you over
- if you had the key, you found a potion of flying earlier
- if you have the sword, you are stuck - GG


Making it over the gap, you see the exit door

    - God's are trying to determine if humans are intrinsicly good or bad
    - undertale style
        - pacifict, mix, kill-everything run
- admins on every floor
    - a final boss
    - defeating them does not necessarily mean fighting them
    - shopkeeper mechanics?
    - early death to teach the player - permadeath game?

Hello %^%%$&#,
You have been given a great opportunity.
Seize it and escape this dungeon.
Make it to the top, and your wish will be fulfilled!

To your left, you will find a chest containing some useful items.
Feel free to use them as you wish, but remember two things:
    ~ Everything has a price
    ~ Actions have consequeces

Good luck!

Sincerely,
The Administators

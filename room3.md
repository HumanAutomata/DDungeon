# Room3

> A throne room, elf / nature themed
> a statue of an elf king is sitting on the throne

> [!NOTE]
> to make it here, you either chose the amulet or the key

You see the exit behind the throne

# if amulet
1. make a run for it - you fail - GG
2. approach the elf

> you get a backstory of the elf - the amulet was his daughter's

1. return the amulet to the king - place it on the statue's hand

Then you get a free passage

you exit through a door behind the throne and start ascending the stairs... to be continued

# if key

1. approach the statue

You see three chests and a note on the floor

1. pick up the note
You pick up the note and it reads:

```
One of these chests holds the key to get out of this room.
The other two... let's say you don't want to open them :)

Before you get sad, and cry out the unfairnes of the world, remember:
"One thing that makes humans unique from other races is their ability to use imagination"

Good Luck!
The Administators
```

1. make a run for it - you think your potion will help, but you fail - GG
2. examine the chests

> describe the chests

- two of them will match the chests you saw before
    - in the start
    - in the previous room
- and the last one will have a new design


## choice
1. pick chest one - devoured by the mimic
2. pick chest two - devoured by the mimic
2. pick chest three - you open the chest and see the amulet you saw at the beginning

> you get a backstory of the elf - the amulet was his daughter's

1. return the amulet to the king - place it on the statue's hand

you exit through a door behind the throne and start ascending the stairs... to be continued

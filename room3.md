# Room3

> A throne room, elf / nature themed
> an statue of an elf king is sitting on the throne

> [!NOTE]
> to make it here, you either chose the amulet or the key

You see the exit behind the throne

# if amulet
1. make a run for it - you fail - GG
2. approach the elf

> you get a backstory of the elf - the amulet was his daughter's

Then you get a free passage

# if key

1. make a run for it - although you are really fast due to the potion, you fail - GG

the elf will give you a choice of 3 chests
- two of them will match the chests you saw before
    - in the start
    - in the previous room
- and the last one will have a new design

hint "One thing that makes humans unique from other races is their ability to use imagination"

- the similar ones are fake mimics, while the different one is correct

if you pick wrong, the mimic will devour you

else, you pass!

you exit through a door behind the throne and start ascending the stairs... to be continued

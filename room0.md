# Room0
- don't remember anything
- list of words: dark, dingy, damp, cramped
- find a note with some information:

```
Hello %^%%$&#,
You have been given a great opportunity.
Seize it and escape this dungeon.
Make it to the top, and your wish will be fulfilled!

To your left, you will find a chest containing some useful items.
Feel free to use them as you wish, but remember two things:
    ~ Everything has a price
    ~ Actions have consequeces

Good luck!

Sincerely,
The Administators
```

## choices
1. do nothing:
- you get prompted to act by some voices
    - maybe you see visions
    - the chest starts to look more enticing to you
- but you keep ignoring it
- you run out of food and die
- or a more "epic" death - ceiling collapses, lava floods the room

2. Examine the chest
Examining the chest you find the following items:

### Items
1. **sword**
    - the fighting / bad choice
    - face more monsters / monsters attack you
    - npcs will like you less, but some might like you more
2. **amulet**
    - the "good choice"
    - it has a picture of a little elf girl
    - words: cute, old, homemade, tattered
    - later find out it belongs to the floor guardian
3. **key**
    - will let the player get some extra item later / travel between room1 and room2
    - fancy, heavy, ancient

As soon as the player picks an item, the chest dissapears
- sinks into the floor, teleports, flash of light and its gone

Then you hear rumbling and some dust falls onto your shoulders
You don't feel safe

## Choice

1. Stay - game over
2. Go to the next room

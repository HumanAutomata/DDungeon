# Room0

- wake up on a bed
- don't remember anything
- list of words: dark, dingy, damp, cramped
- find a note with some information:

```
Hello %^%%$&#,
You have been given a great opportunity.
Seize it and escape this dungeon.
Make it to the top, and your wish will be fulfilled!

To your left, you will find a chest containing some useful items.
Feel free to use them as you wish, but remember two things:
    ~ Everything has a price
    ~ Actions have consequeces

Good luck!

Sincerely,
The Administators
```

## Choices

### Good
- 

### Neutral
- do nothing
- you get prompted to act by some voices
    - maybe you see visions
    - the chest starts to look more enticing to you
- but you keep ignoring it
- you run out of food and die
- or a more "epic" death - ceiling collapses, lava floods the room

### Bad

words: mossy, nature, jewels imbedded in the walls that give off light

You exit to room and enter a mossy tunnel. As you keep walking, you
notice that the light is coming from, what seems to be, jewels embeded in the walls.

G: "Those jewels look Greeekkk. They would sell for a pretty penny. ahhaahaa. Greeekkk!"
S: "Wow! Those rocks are so pretty!"

## Choice

You feel like you are making progress. It seems to be getting looser.
However, you are getting a bad feeling about this - it seems to be moving on it's own.

## Choice
1. give up
2. keep going

No matter what choice, the outcome has already been determined

Before you can come to a decision, a crack appears on the wall.
As you try to move away, you realize, to your horror, that the light is attached to *something*.
It's limb flies out and crushes you. - END

As you keep walking you come across an intersection with two doors.
The first door is sturdy, and it's made out of rock.
The second door smells like fresh cut grass, and it's made out of wood.

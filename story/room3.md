You try to rush for the exit, but the statue turns its head and shoots magic out of its eyes, disentegrating you - END

As you approach the throne, you see that the statue is holding out its hand, as if asking for something.

G: "Give him the Amulet. Greekkk!"

```
One of these chests holds the key to get out of this room.

Before you get sad, and cry out the unfairnes of the world, remember:
"One thing that makes humans unique from other races is their ability to use imagination"

Good Luck!

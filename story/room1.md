# Room1

As you enter, you see a rocky expanse, with many rocks strewn about and small hills in the distance.
Although it looks like a cave, you get the sense that it's unnatural --- maybe even something manmade.

As you walk past one of the rocks, it starts to shift and grow taller.
You realize that it's actually a rock Golem.

# if you have the amulet
G: "Use the, Greeekkkk, amulet on them. It will stop them. Greekkkk!"
S: "Q-q-quick! Use the amulet. It will put them back to sleep"

1. use the amulet and Golem stops moving
2. ignore the voice and you get crushed by the golem - END

You keep walking forward and come across another wooden chest, distinct from the one you saw before.

## choice
1. examine it
> describe the chest
2. ignore it and move on

### if you examined it
1. try to open it
You try to open it, but it doesn't budge.
G: "You Greekkk don't have the key. Greekk!"
S: "You need a key to open it, silly!"

2. keep moving

You eventually reach an exit and quickly leave.

# if you have the sword

G: "Fight it, Greeekkk! Show em who's boss. Greeeeeeeekkkkk!"
S: "R-r-ruuuuuun!"

1. fight it
You swing your blade at the Golem. As you do, you remember that you've never actually swung a sword before,
and that using a sword against rock might not be smartest idea you've ever had.

The blade hits the Golem's torso, but nothing happens. It looks down on you and crushes you with it's fist. - END

2. run

3. ignore the voice
You ignore your companion and just star at the Golem in awe. I crushes you under its foot. - END

## if you ran
You start running and stumble upon a chest.

## choice
1. try to open it
G: "You need a key to open it. Greekk!"
S: "Um..., I think you need a key to open that"

2. keep running
You keep running, but slowly, more and more golems come alive. Eventually, you are surrounded, and crushed. - END

# if you have the key
G: "Run, you Greekkk! Maybe you will find something that will help you. Greeekkk!"
S: "R-r-ruuuunnnn!"

1. fight it
You punch the Golem, but it definitely hurt you more than it hurt it.
The Golem punches you back and crushes you - END

2. run

3. ignore the voice and you get crushed by the golem - GG

## if you ran
You stumble upon a chest. This one is green, with a horizontal white stripe.
## choice
1. keep running
You keep running, but eventually you get surrounded by golems and get crushed. - END

2. try to open it
It needs a key to open
### if you tried to open it
1. use the key
You use the key and see a potion in the chest.

G: "It's a potion of swiftness, Greeekkk! Quickly drink it an Greeeeeeeekkkkk!"
S: "Oh My Godess! It-it-it's a potion if swiftness. I didn't know any still existed. Q-q-quickly drink it and run"

### choice
1. "I don't trust you"
You don't drink the potions and keep running. The golems eventually surround you and you die - END
2. drink the potion

You drink the potion and find that it has a surprisingly pleasant taste.
As the liquid goes down your throat, you feel lighter than you've ever felt before.

The Golems can't keep up with your speed anymore. When you start running again, you leave them in the dust.

You eventually find the exit and escape.

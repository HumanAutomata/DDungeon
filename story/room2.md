> words: green, nature, lush, full of life, magical, 5
> as you enter you see a garden, and small faries flying around and taking care of herbs

# if you have the amulet

They will approach and try to communicate

> 5 faries approach you and say:
    - you notice that they all have 5 pairs of wings
    - encoded text using a ceaser cypher (rot 5)
    - something like:
        this human looks kind,
        maybe Njord (a nice Norse god) had a point

## Choice
---

1. ignore them and try to find an exit
- they will leave you alone and not interact with you
2. attack / try to capture one
- they will swarm you - GG
3. try and talk back to them

### if you ignore them
you keep walking and come to an abyss - a big gap you can't cross

#### choice
1. wait - a dragon claw grabs you and pulls you into the abyss - GG
2. try to jump across - you do a run up, jump, and fall into the abyss - GG

### if you talk to the faries
You don't understand their language, but they follow you around.
You keep walking and come across an abyss

#### choice
As you try to figure out a way to cross, the fairies surround you.
They pick you up and carry you over the gap.

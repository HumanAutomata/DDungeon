# Room0

You slowly wake up in an unfamiliar bed. It's cold. It's dark. It's damp.

You can't remember anything, and everytime you try to think, you get a splitting headache.

As you look around you, you see a cramped and dingy room. There's a dim light above that alluminates your
sorroundings, but you can't make out it's source. On your left, you see a chest. On top of lies a note.

You pick it up and it reads:
```
Hello %^%%$&#,
You have been given a great opportunity.
Seize it and escape this dungeon.
Make it to the top, and your wish will be fulfilled!

To your left, you will find a chest containing some useful items.
Feel free to use them as you wish, but remember two things:
    ~ Everything has a price
    ~ Actions have consequeces

Good luck!

Sincerely,
The Administators
```

## choose a companion
As you finish reading the note, a booming voice resonates in your head.
"CHOOSE A COMPANION, ADVENTURER!"

Then you see two siluettes. On of them seems to be a goblin, and the other a spirit.

### choose the companion
From now on, the Goblin dialogue will start with G: and the spirit's dialogue will start with S:

G: "You should look inside the chest, Greeekkk!"
S: "Ah..., maybe you should look inside the chest. Only if you want, of course. You don't h-h-have to."

## choices
1. do nothing:

G: "You should reaaaaly --- Greeekkk --- use the chest. Greeekkk!"
S: "I know I s-s-said you don't have to, but maybe you should, like, examine the chest"

### If you keep ignoring it
You start to hear rumbling and the ceiling starts to collapse on top of you. At the same time, lava starts
flooding the room, and it slowly engulfs the bed you are laying on. - END

2. Examine the chest

You look more closely at the chest. It's got a blood red colour, with vertical brown stripes.
Opening it, you see the following items:

### Items
1. **sword**
    - the fighting / bad choice
    - face more monsters / monsters attack you
    - npcs will like you less, but some might like you more
2. **amulet**
    - the "good choice"
    - it has a picture of a little elf girl
    - words: cute, old, homemade, tattered
    - later find out it belongs to the floor guardian
3. **key**
    - will let the player get some extra item later
    - fancy, heavy, ancient

As soon as the you choose an items, the chest sinks into the floor and dissapears.

Then you hear rumbling and some dust falls onto your shoulders.

G: "Hurry up and get out the room, Greeekkk!"
S: "You s-s-should probably leave"

## Choice
1. Stay - same death as above
2. Go to the next room

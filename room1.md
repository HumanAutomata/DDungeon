> words: earth, rock, jagged

as you enter, you see a rock expanse, with many rocks and small hills
This looks more like a cave, than something manmade

As you walk past one of the rocks, it starts to shift and grow taller.
You realize that it's actually a rock Golem.

# if you have the amulet
---
> a voice in your head tells you to use it you can use it to freeze the golems and walk past them
1. use the amulet and Golem stops moving
2. ignore the voice and you get crushed by the golem - GG

You keep walking forward and come across another wooden chest, distinct from the one you saw before

> describe the chest

## choice
---
1. examine it
> describe the chest
2. ignore it and move on

### if you examined it
---
1. try to open it - you can't, you need a key
2. keep moving

You eventually reach an exit and quickly leave

2. run - you start running and slowly more and more golems come alive

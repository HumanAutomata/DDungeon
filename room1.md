# Room1

words: earth, rock, jagged

as you enter, you see a rock expanse, with many rocks and small hills
This looks more like a cave, than something manmade

As you walk past one of the rocks, it starts to shift and grow taller.
You realize that it's actually a rock Golem.

1. if you have the amulet, you can use it to freeze the golems and walk past them
2. if you have the key, you need to hide from them until you find a chest.
    in the chest you find a potion of swiftness which you can use to outrun them
3. if you had the sword, you will try to hide first and then fight them, but you realize your sword is useless
    you get crushed by them - GG

if you make it past all the golems, you see the exit and go through it
